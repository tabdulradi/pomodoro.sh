# pomodoro.sh
All bash pomodoro timer. Wrote because I waste my time on the internet, so better waste it writing yet another pomodoro app, right?

## Usage
```./pomodoro.sh```
or 
```./pomodoro.sh 25 5```.


For best result increase font size on your terminal.

Note: Works on OSX only, but you can adapt `announce` to work on Linux too.
